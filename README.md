Technical architecture and implementation details of the Locksmith Connection Platform. The platform aims to connect customers with locksmiths in real-time, facilitating efficient and reliable locksmith services.

**Backend Architecture:**
* Node.js and Express.js: For building the web server and API.
* MongoDB: For storing user data, service requests, and other information.
* Socket.IO: For real-time communication between the server and clients.
* bcrypt: For password hashing.
* jsonwebtoken: For generating and verifying JWT tokens.
* Google Maps API: For location-based services and distance calculations.
 
**User Authentication:**
* User Registration:
* Users can register with their name, email, and password.
* Password is hashed using bcrypt for security.
* User Login:
* Users can log in with their email and password.
* Successful login generates a JWT token for authentication.

**Service Requests:**
* Creating Service Requests:
* Users can create service requests specifying location and service type.
* Service requests are stored in the MongoDB database.

**Real-time Notifications:**
* Socket.IO is used to emit notifications to connected locksmiths when a new service request is created.
* Locksmiths can accept or decline service requests in real-time.

**Frontend Architecture**
* React: For building the user interface.
* Socket.IO Client: For real-time communication with the server.
* Google Maps API: For displaying maps and calculating distances.
